LiveView Notifications
=========================

For Sony LiveView

IMPORTANT: This application only works in combination with the Sony LiveView Smartwatch.

This LiveView-plugin makes sure that ALL the notifications will be send to the LiveView.
Not just the SMS or Email notification, every notification!

The application needs additional permissions to make this happen.
You can give this permission by enabling this app as Accessibility Service

Don't forget to also enable this plugin in the LiveView settings.

See the screenshots at Google Play to know how to enable this app.
